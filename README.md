# FiDi Chainlink Pricing Widget
FiDi Chainlink Pricing: Seamlessly surface token pricing data via FiDi-powered analytical widgets, oracle-powered sources, and beyond.

# Bear Necessities Hackathon - FiDi Project
FiDi is a comprehensive multi-chain portfolio tracker that provides secure advanced analytics, intuitive UX, and high-precision data across 100+ chains and 2k+ protocols. As a part of the Bear Necessities Hackathon, we are excited to propose the addition of user's wallet analytics augmented with Chainlink's pricing and NFT analytical data to our platform.

We are publishing the sample pricing module for the benefit of the community.


# Features
- FiDi Chainlink Pricing supports native wallet addresses such as those provided by Metamask, Ledger, Talisman, Polkadot js, SubWallet, and many more; the project aims to provide coverage for all substrate wallet providers. 
- FiDi Chainlink Pricing leverages the same data primitives available on FiDi and thus provides data coverage for 100+ chains and 2k+ protocols.
- The prices are currently surfaced in the USD equivalents.
- The wallet assets default view is currently used to surface the pricing.
- Widgets can be intuitively embedded into external modules.
